# Arduino part of the project
I have split the codes into two parts, one which is testing for X86 so that we can run it on our computer. The other part is pure Arduino. I have included a makefile in the X86 folder for compilation, flags are inserted into the source files in the Arduino folder to make the file compileable on Arduino or X86.
